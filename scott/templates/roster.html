            <a style= "font-size: 15px;">An organization requested the development of an attendance tracking solution. To meet this requirement,<br/>
                a Python/Django application was created that utilized Twilio to send text messages containing a link for event sign-up to a list<br/>
                of possible attendees, and to send reminders on the day of the event. The application also utilized Postgres as its database, and <br/>
                was successful in its initial deployment. To enhance its functionality, the ability to add new attendees to the database using their<br/>
                sign-up information was added and has proven to work well.<br/><br/></a>
